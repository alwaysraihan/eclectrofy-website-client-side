                Difference between javascript and nodejs?
            </h1>
            <p className="text-xl">
                Javascript is a scripting language that runs in any browser
                JavaScript Engine.Whereas Node JS is an interpreter or runtime
                environment for a JavaScript programming language. Node js can
                run the javascript code on the server side. Node js runs on the
                V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

                Differences between sql and nosql databases ?
            </h1>
            <p className="text-xl">
                The main difference between sql and nosql database is tahat, SQl
                is a relational database and nosql is a nor-relational database.
                SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are
                document based, SQL databases are better for multi-row data,
                while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like JSON.

                What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work ?
            </h1>
            <p className="text-xl">
                Basically Json Web Token(jwt) used for security purpose between
                two parties â€” a client and a server. JSON Web Token (JWT) is an
                open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for
                securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON
                object. If we use JWT then our api data will be accesable for
                varified user . Without verify user can not able to acces data
                form api or sever side.
